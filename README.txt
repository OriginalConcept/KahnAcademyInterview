\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hey!  Thanks for checking out my project.  \
\
Here\'92s a little bit about it.\
\

\cf0 1. Acorn.js vs Esprima:\
	I chose to use Esprima on the basis of superior documentation and support.  Esprima has a speed comparison page ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://esprima.org/test/compare.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc0 http://esprima.org/test/compare.html}}).  Esprima is around 50% slower than Acorn.js but the absolute difference should not be relevant.\
\
\'93\'92Acorn.js\'94 tutorial' turned up about 8,000 results on google, while '\'94Esprima\'94 tutorial' produced about 32,000 results.  This is more important to me.\
\
2. I could not test this program on Internet Explorer but everything is fully functional on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\
\
3. I could not fully figure out Esprima so I only use the tokenizer.  The documentation is woefully brief.  As a result, did not do test case 3.\
\
4. Ace is amazingly nice.  It made this project a lot easier.\
\
5.  There\'92s no slowdown to user input. \
